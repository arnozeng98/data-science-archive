    "In this exercise you're going to be comparing different clusterings of the dataset to see if they are consistent, using the [adjusted rand index](https://scikit-learn.org/stable/modules/generated/sklearn.metrics.adjusted_rand_score.html) (ARI).  Note that the ARI is not really comparable across different numbers of clusters, so you'll have to stick to a single $k$ for the rest of this exercise, based on what you saw in 1.2. The ARI will be negative if the proposed clusters are very different, and closer to 1.0 if they are nearly the same.  Depending on your elbow, among other factors, you could get wildly different mean ARIs, but it should be positive, at least - if it isn't, you may want to pick a different value of k.  In the next section, you'll have the opportunity to tune some of the other values.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, you're going to be looking at the consistency of clustering across different random iterations of k-means with the same data and parameters. You should run at least 10 different runs of k-means (again using MiniBatchKMeans), exhaustively calculate the pairwise ARI for the resulting label set, and print out an average. It would be a good idea to use a function here, especially since you'll need to do this again later."

Instead of exhaustively pairing a list of clusterings derived from a single representation (as you did in 1.3 and directly above) to check how consistent the clusterings are, you will be exhaustively pairing two lists of 10 clusterings, one list of clusterings derived using Matrix 1 (i.e. the original representation), and one of clusterings from one of the other three matrices (in 1.3 you were doing comparisons analogous to \"pdist\", whereas here you are doing something analogous to \"cdist\"). \n",

With the results for 2, 3, and 4 for the internal consistency testing, you should be displaying a total of 6 numbers here, make sure you clearly identify which is which! For full points, use functions, and try to avoid redoing the same clustering again and again."

    "From the results, we can see that the first 50 principal components (0-50) of SVD can capture the core features of the data well, have high internal consistency (0.39), and achieve a good balance between dimensionality reduction efficiency and information retention. The subsequent principal components (50-500) mainly contain low-variance features or noise, and their consistency and information retention effects are extremely low (0.05 and close to 0). Overall, it is reasonable to choose a dimension of `k=30` based on the elbow rule, which not only effectively reduces the dimension but also retains enough information for clustering, but may lose some consistency with the details of the original matrix."

Increase the total number of iterations and run again if perplexity has not converged (you can say it has coveraged if there is less than a 5 point drop in perplexity in the final iteration). This will take a while (probably at least half an hour), so work on something else while you wait....

I have no idea what PHMNL means but giving access to it is practically like handing over a gun to someone who wants to assassinate me.   Why they want to get it is beyond me. The only thing remotely related to incriminating evidence they will find in my corporate email inbox are my work-related angsts, my pictures and my MP3s. Name one person in Kulitibank who doesn�t have any of the three in his PC and I will gladly write William Hung�s name using my butt.    Operation: Get Password  was carried out by Cruella de Ville, Oilve Oyl's sneaky and manipulative sidekick. Cruella is officially the �Junior IC� (a.k.a.  alalay ) but more often than not, she�s Olive Oyl�s hatchet woman.    Attempt No. 1  (On my cellphone)  Cruella: Heeeey, you know what, I can�t access the files in the laptop you surrendered�  Glenville: Naturally, Cruella. That�s because you don�t have my password.  Cruella: Yah, I know. But I just wanted to delete your files like what I did for Rose when she resigned.  Para clean siya .  Glenville: You can have it reformatted by the IT people. Everything�s gonna be wiped out.  Cruella: But�  Glenville: At this point, I really don�t want to give anyone my password. I am accountable for it and giving it to another employee is tantamount to violating the policy that I am not supposed to let anyone know of my password. (Capiche? Besides, I know who sent you. Go back to kissing Olive Oyl�s ass!)  Cruella: Ok.   Attempt No. 2  (A week later)  Cruella: Hi there! The IT guys can�t crack the PHMNL access. They can�t reformat your laptop either.  Glenville: Really? What if I forgot my password, then the laptop is useless? The IT people have administrator functions. They should be able to access and reformat my laptop even without my password. I guess the IT guys should be working as call center agents� (I am not a techie but I am not a dum-dum either)  Cruella: Oh, ok.   Attempt No. 3  (The truth unravels�)  Cruella calls me up on a Sunday evening warning me of Olive Oyl�s evil intentions  kuno .  Cruella: Hello, I just wanted to warn you.  Glenville: Warn me of what? (That your brain cells are actually working?)  Cruella: No, it�s just that I think Olive Oyl wants to snoop around your files. She told me that she wanted to look for something she can pin you down with.  Glenville: But why? I resigned already. Isn�t she happy?  Cruella: I think she wants to cover her tracks.  Glenville: Because she�s in a hot seat?  Cruella: I guess so. Three new hirees have resigned for the past 6 months, including you. A senior IC asked to be transferred to another department and another semi-senior IC has just resigned to join another bank. I think she can justify the others� moves but not yours. So she�s looking for a justifiable reason for your resignation in your files.  Glenville: Oh, I see. She wants to look for something she can blame me with so that it will look like her hands are totally clean.  Cruella: You should really give me your password so that I can delete your files before Olive Oyl gets to them. I really want to help you. (Warning bells! It�s not really in Cruella�s nature to help)  Glenville: No, thanks. I have nothing to hide anyway. Let Olive Oyl try to access my files. I think I even forgot what my password was already.  Cruella: You sure about that?  Glenville: Yep, thanks anyway.  For the record, all my files have been deleted, purged, emptied. I never told Cruella because I wanted her and Olive Oyl to go nuts trying to find a way to get my password. In the meantime, I am getting gas at holding in my laughter.

    "This lab explored topic modeling and cluster analysis of text data through unsupervised learning methods such as K-means and LDA. The K-means method is efficient and suitable for quickly exploring data distribution, but it is sensitive to initial parameters and requires dimensionality reduction to improve the performance of high-dimensional data; although LDA topic modeling takes a long time to train and requires more hyperparameter adjustments, it can generate more semantically interpretable topics and is suitable for text analysis tasks. Compared with supervised methods, unsupervised methods do not require labels but the results are more difficult to verify. They are suitable for exploring unknown patterns or providing inspiration for supervised learning. In the future, the model effect can be further improved by combining semi-supervised learning (such as introducing some known labels), reducing the cost of parameter adjustment and training while improving the accuracy of topic modeling.\n",
