    "## Background\n",
    "\n",
    "In recent years, with the increasing aging population and rising health awareness, healthcare systems are facing growing service pressure. The widespread adoption of Electronic Medical Records (EMR) in medical informatization offers new possibilities to address these challenges. To achieve standardized management and sharing of medical data, the World Health Organization (WHO) has developed the International Classification of Diseases (ICD). This standard converts tens of thousands of diseases and their combinations into a standardized alphanumeric coding system, laying the foundation for cross-regional and cross-institutional medical data exchange and analysis.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, manually converting EMR text into ICD codes is time-consuming, labor-intensive, and prone to human errors. Developing an automated ICD coding system can improve coding efficiency and consistency while providing more reliable data support for disease research and medical management.\n",
    "\n",
    "To advance this goal, this competition has constructed a special dataset for evaluating automated ICD coding in Chinese EMRs. The dataset is built using de-identified medical records, covering five primary diagnosis ICD-10 codes and 53 additional diagnosis ICD-10 codes, with a total of 1,485 records."

    "## Task Description\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Objective\n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of this task is to utilize Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques to analyze patients’ clinical symptoms from electronic medical record texts, extract key symptom information, and determine both primary diagnosis codes and additional diagnosis codes. This assists doctors or medical coders in accurately completing ICD coding.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Definition\n",
    "\n",
    "Given a text description of a patient's medical history, chief complaint, current illness history, past medical history, and discharge status, the model needs to predict:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Primary Diagnosis Code (only one ICD-10 code per record)\n",
    "- Additional Diagnosis Codes (one or more ICD-10 codes per record)\n",
    "\n",
    "### Task Input & Output\n",
    "\n",
    "- Input: A string (str type) containing clinical information extracted from medical records.\n",
    "- Output: A list where the primary diagnosis code and additional diagnosis codes are separated by a `\"|\"` delimiter, and the additional diagnosis codes are separated by a `\";\"` delimiter.\n",
